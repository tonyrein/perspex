				h2 What is Perspex?
				hr
				p Perspex is a Web application designed to retrieve data generated by a HonSSH honeypot system.
				h2 Help for the #[a(href="/build_query") Build Query page]
				hr
				h3 On this page you can construct a query and retrieve data from Elasticsearch based on that query. The data will be returned as a CSV file; it is planned to add other formats in future.
				h4 Limitations:
				p At this stage, the available queries are somewhat limited. You can specify for the various parameters in the left-hand column the values you want included, but you can't (so far) specify values to exclude. Also, the query is constructed by combining the parameters with 'AND;' 'OR' is not yet available.
				h4 How to use this page:
				p In the left-hand column, select the type of record you're interested in and fill in any values you want to specify, along with the number of records you want to return. The default number of records is 10; be aware that returning very large numbers of records will take some time.
				p In the right-hand column, select start and stop dates if desired. If you leave "any" checked, then there will be no minimum or maximum for that respective end of the date range. You may un-check both in order to specify both the start and end of the date range, or you may leave one checked - in that case you will find all records before the end date, or since the start date.
				p The dates are all in UTC (Greenwich) and are in ISO8601 format - that is "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ," where "YYYY" represents the four-digit year, "MM" the month, "DD" the day of the month, and so on. The literal "T"  marks the beginning of the time portion of the string, and the "Z" represents the time zone. Do not change either the "T" or the "Z." For detailed information on this format, see #[a(href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime") here] or #[a(href="http://xkcd.com/1179/") here].
				p Then check the boxes for the fields you want to retrieve. Leaving them all un-checked is the same as selecting all, except that for session downloads, the file contents are NOT retrieved by default.
				p When you're ready, click "Retrieve CSV."
